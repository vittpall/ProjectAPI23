# ProjectAPI23
API project 2022/2023. 
Professor: Martinenghi Davide 
Student: Palladino Vittorio 
Scores: 30 out of 30L 

The purpose was to find the shorter path between two station in an highway. Each station has a different amount of eletric cars and each of them have a autonomy express in km. The station is also defined by a value (also express in km) which express the distance from the begging of the highway.
Let me get this straight with an example: given in input the stations 30 and 40 the algorithm needs to use the minimun amount of station to reach 40 starting from 30, this thing could be achieved scanning trough each middle station and finding the one that has a car which can arrive to the other checkpoint. Note: the chosen station needs to be nearest to the begging of the road.
